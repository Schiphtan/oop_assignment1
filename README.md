It has exercises about abstract and interface


exercises on interfaces
==========================

1. Write a  program to create an interface Shape with the getArea() method. Create three classes Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle that implement the Shape interface. Implement the getArea() method for each of the three classes.



2. Write a  program to create a Animal interface with a method called bark() that takes no arguments and returns void. Create a Dog class that implements Animal and overrides speak() to print "Dog is barking".



3. Write a  program to create an interface Flyable with a method called fly_obj(). Create three classes Spacecraft, Airplane, and Helicopter that implement the Flyable interface. Implement the fly_obj() method for each of the three classes.



4. Write a  program to create a banking system with three classes - Bank, Account, SavingsAccount, and CurrentAccount. The bank should have a list of accounts and methods for adding them. Accounts should be an interface with methods to deposit, withdraw, calculate interest, and view balances. SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount should implement the Account interface and have their own unique methods.



5. Write a  program to create an interface Resizable with methods resizeWidth(int width) and resizeHeight(int height) that allow an object to be resized. Create a class Rectangle that implements the Resizable interface and implements the resize methods.



6. Write a  program to create an interface Drawable with a method draw() that takes no arguments and returns void. Create three classes Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle that implement the Drawable interface and override the draw() method to draw their respective shapes.



7. Write a  program to create an interface Sortable with a method sort() that sorts an array of integers in ascending order. Create two classes BubbleSort and SelectionSort that implement the Sortable interface and provide their own implementations of the sort() method.



8. Write a  program to create an interface Playable with a method play() that takes no arguments and returns void. Create three classes Football, Volleyball, and Basketball that implement the Playable interface and override the play() method to play the respective sports.



9. Write a  program to create an interface Searchable with a method search(String keyword) that searches for a given keyword in a text document. Create two classes Document and WebPage that implement the Searchable interface and provide their own implementations of the search() method.



10. Write a  program to create an interface Encryptable with methods encrypt (String data) and decrypt (String encryptedData) that define encryption and decryption operations. Create two classes AES and RSA that implement the Encryptable interface and provide their own encryption and decryption algorithms.


11. Write a  program to create an interface Sortable with a method sort (int[] array) that sorts an array of integers in descending order. Create two classes QuickSort and MergeSort that implement the Sortable interface and provide their own implementations of the sort() method.


Abstract exercises
========================

1.Create an abstract class 'Parent' with a method 'message'. It has two subclasses each having a method with the same name 'message' that prints "This is first subclass" and "This is second subclass" respectively. Call the methods 'message' by creating an object for each subclass.

2.Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'getBalance'. $100, $150 and $200 are deposited in banks A, B and C respectively. 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' are subclasses of class 'Bank', each having a method named 'getBalance'. Call this method by creating an object of each of the three classes.

3.We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. Create an abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same name which returns the percentage of the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student B. Create an object for eac of the two classes and print the percentage of marks for both the students.

4.An abstract class has a construtor which prints "This is constructor of abstract class", an abstract method named 'a_method' and a non-abstract method which prints "This is a normal method of abstract class". A class 'SubClass' inherits the abstract class and has a method named 'a_method' which prints "This is abstract method". Now create an object of 'SubClass' and call the abstract method and the non-abstract method. (Analyse the result)

5.Create an abstract class 'Animals' with two abstract methods 'cats' and 'dogs'. Now create a class 'Cats' with a method 'cats' which prints "Cats meow" and a class 'Dogs' with a method 'dogs' which prints "Dogs bark", both inheriting the class 'Animals'. Now create an object for each of the subclasses and call their respective methods.

6.We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a square and a circle. Create an abstract class 'Shape' with three abstract methods namely 'RectangleArea' taking two parameters, 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' taking one parameter each. The parameters of 'RectangleArea' are its length and breadth, that of 'SquareArea' is its side and that of 'CircleArea' is its radius. Now create another class 'Area' containing all the three methods 'RectangleArea', 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' for printing the area of rectangle, square and circle respectively. Create an object of class 'Area' and call all the three methods.
